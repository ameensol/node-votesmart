## node-votesmart
Node.js library for interacting with the Project Vote Smart API.

The Project Vote Smart API provides detailed information on politicians, including bios, votes, and NPAT responses. (http://votesmart.org/share/api)

I've only added support for the methods I have been using. If you require methods you don't see, please contribute to this repo. Use the current methods as a template.
